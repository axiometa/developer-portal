## Meet Genesis

**Genesis IoT Discovery Lab** is a hands-on modular kit powered by the **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R2**, designed for quick prototyping, real-world learning, and portable experimentation.

At its core: a sleek board with **eight universal AX22 ports**. Around it: a growing family of **50+ plug-and-play modules**‚Äîfrom sensors and displays to relays, motors, and NeoPixels. Just snap in a module and start coding. No jumper wires. No guesswork. No digging for pinouts.

It is all open hardware. All reusable. And it just works.

## One Port. Endless Possibilities.

Every **AX22 port** has a standard 10-pin layout with everything you need‚Äî**I¬≤C, SPI, UART, ADC, 3√ó GPIOs**, power, and ground. That means **any module can go into any port**, no rewiring or reconfiguring required.

![AX22 overview](ax22-overview.webp "AX22 Port Pinout")

| Pin | Signal         | Function                             |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | GND            | Ground                               |
| 2   | 3.3V           | Power                                |
| 3   | IO1            | GPIO / ADC                           |
| 4   | IO2 / UART TX  | GPIO / Chip Select / Serial TX       |
| 5   | IO3 / UART RX  | GPIO / Serial RX                     |
| 6   | MOSI           | SPI                                  |
| 7   | MISO           | SPI                                  |
| 8   | SCK            | SPI Clock                            |
| 9   | SDA            | I¬≤C Data                             |
| 10  | SCL            | I¬≤C Clock                            |

Modules snap in with the correct alignment every time. Whether you're writing Arduino sketches, building MicroPython projects, or working with ESP-IDF, AX22 ports remove the wiring hassle and let you focus on building fast.

## Just Plug It In

Want to monitor temperature and humidity? Drop in a **DHT11** or **BME280** module. Need motion sensing? Snap in a **VL53L0CX**. Ready to light things up? Add a **NeoPixel matrix** or **relay driver**.

![AX22 Examples](ax22-examples.webp)

All modules speak a common language: plug into any port, call the matching helper (`genesis.dht11()`, `genesis.bme280()`, `genesis.relay()`, etc.), and start prototyping.

No breadboards. No errors. Just working hardware.

## Some examples

## Case study

There are hundreds of projects and development cases you could go through but, for the sake of simplicity, lets take a simple example. A light that flashes/tracks the sounds of music.

For this we would need an LED and a Microphone.

It can be plugged into the matrix like this:

![AX22 Light Reactive Lights](ax22-casestudy.webp)


```cpp
#include <AX22-0009-MIC.h>
#include <AX22-0028-LED.h>

// The mic is on port 6, LED on port 8
MatrixMic mic(6); 
MatrixLED led(8);

void setup() {
  mic.begin();
  led.begin();
}

void loop() {
  int volume = mic.getVolume();     // e.g., returns 0‚Äì1023
  int brightness = map(volume, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  led.setBrightness(brightness);   // Brightness reacts to sound
  delay(20);                       // Smooth reaction
}
```

And that's it, that's a working project.

## AX22 Integration

AX22 Ports are designed to be fully transferable‚Äîso you can integrate them into your own custom PCBs and still benefit from the shared ecosystem of modules.
This gives you the freedom to build your own hardware while maintaining compatibility with a growing library of plug-and-play components.

GENESIS isnt a system its a board that carries 8x AX22 Ports. Which means you could have other boards, with different MCUs and different port count (See disclaimer). In this first pilot run, GENESIS runs on a custom ESP32-S3 board, as its perfect for testing IoT, BT and a myriad of peripherals.

## Documentation

The entire project is built around openness and accessibility, which means we are taking the time to do it right. Every single module will have its own dedicated landing page like [this one](https://axiometa.ai/product/ax22-0004-potentiometer/) with KiCad project files, schematics, 3D models, and a clear usage guide.

We are still finalizing the full library, but everything will be fully documented and ready by launch.

## Disclaimer

Yes, at first glance this might look like ‚Äúyet another hardware standard.‚Äù That was never the goal.

I was building my own microcontrollers and just needed a few peripherals. At some point, I realized it would be helpful if at least the ground pin was always in the same place‚Äîsounds obvious, but it was not during months of sleep deprivation.

So I started placing other pins consistently too. Three GPIOs were easy. Fitting UART, I2C, SPI, analog, and digital into 10 pins‚Ä¶ took some trial and error.

After a few modules, I thought: might as well make a matching port to plug them straight into the MCU. Then I made an ESP32-S3 board with 8 of these ports. It worked.

I kept going‚Äîmore modules, more sensors‚Äîand eventually, it became a whole ecosystem.

Not planned. Just happened organically.
